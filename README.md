 **The four horseman of the apocalypse in Wurm**

An **Apocalypse Stone** will spawn in the world. The horseman **Conquest** will spawn first. Once killed, the next horseman will spawn named **War**. Once killed, the next horseman will spawn named **Famine**. Once killed, the last horseman will spawn named **Death**.
